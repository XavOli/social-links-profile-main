## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I started learning bootstrap today and tried to make this project with as little raw CSS as I could. I made some minor styling change from the challenge template to make it more to my taste and tried setting it up as my landing page for github.

### Continued development

I'll have to change my btn-group-vertical to an ul with the btn as li to be able to get spacing between the btn elements. This is something I will take into consideration as I get more comfortable with Bootstrap.
